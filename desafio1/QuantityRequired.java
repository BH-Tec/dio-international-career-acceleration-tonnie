Challenge
Each pizza is made up of 4 slices. There are N friends and each friend needs exactly X slices. You will have to create code capable of calculating the minimum number of pizzas they must order to satisfy their appetite.

Input
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, indicating the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers. N for the number of friends and X for the amount of slice each friend wants.

Output
For each test case, produce the minimum number of pizzas required, as shown in the example below:
There is only 1 friend who needs 5 slices. If he sends 1 pizza, he will only receive 4 slices. So at least 2 pizzas must be ordered to have the required number of slices.
